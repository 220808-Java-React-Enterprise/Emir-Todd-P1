## Project Description:
 We were tasked with building a back-end API that will support a new internal expense reimbursement system.
This system manages the process of reimbursing of employees for expenses incurred while on company time. 
All registered employees can login and submit requests for reimbursement with their reimbursement details. 
They can also view past reimbursement submissions and pending requests. On the other end Finance managers 
can log in and view all reimbursements requests, sort them by status or type and the history of all closed 
reimbursement requests. Finance managers are authorized to make a decision on these requests for the expense reimbursement.
